# Phyto1
Phytoplankton model 1

The code is in python 3. Basic python modules such as NumPy and Matplotlib are necessary.

Preparation;
1. Download all the files and put it in one folder.
2. Arrange path for each file

Ploting figures;
Note that each file has a flag for N limiting and P limiting;
"What_is_limiting=1  #0: P-limiting  1:N-limiting".
Change values (0 or 1) according to the purpose.

Fig. 3; Run a800_05_12_06

Fig. 4; Run a800_05_12_06 (for subplots A and D),
        Run a800_04_43_05 (for other subplots)
        
Fig. 5; Run a800_04_33_89 (for subplots A~C),
        For other subplots, first, run a800_05_12_06, a822_20_02, and a822_30_02_10 to create output files.
        Then, run a1000_01_04 for plotting them.

Fig. S2; Run a800_04_60_11 and a800_04_70_11_10 for the figures in the top and bottom rows, respectively.
